we use column major matrix

[	a1	b1	c1	d1	]
[	a2	b2	c2	d2	]
[	a3	b3	c3	d3	]
[	a4	b4	c4	d4	]

Post-multiplication: Mv

Call order is the reverse of the order in the transforms are applied: "take P, transform by T, transform by Rz, transform by Ry" is written as P1 = Ry * Rz * T * P

The translation values are stored in the d1, d2, and d3 elements.
