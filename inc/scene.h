/**
 * @brief Calculates if a sphere was hit by a ray
 * 
 * A quadratic equation gives input on whether the sphere was hit or not.
 * Solutions to this equation can be determined with the discriminant of
 * -b +- sqr(bÂ² - 4ac)/(2a)
 * 
 * Discriminant
 * - is positive => two real solutions = sphere hit twice
 * - is zero => one real solution = one tangential hit
 * - is negative => no real solutions = miss
 * @param sp_centre Centre of the sphere
 * @param r 		Radius of the sphere
 * @param ray 		Ray shot into scene
 * @return true 	If sphere was hit by ray
 * @return false 	If sphere was missed by ray
